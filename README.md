SAS_Project
===========
*In this final project, we use five data sets, that is: GDP growth rate in Africa, Global Product Price, Protest frequency in each African Country,
Corruption Percentages Index (CPI), which represents corruption degree of each country and last, diversification and competiveness index of each
African Country;

*Our primary goal is to predict the protest frequency of Libya in the future five years based on our prediction of
gold price in the future five years, as we found there is a correlation between GDP growth rate, Protest frequency, global gold price, and CPI
 after we figuring out the correlation matrix of them. We first make correlation matrix of GDP growth rate, gold cocoa and oil price and then we 
found there are positive correlations existing between GDP growth rate and oil price. Then we did a prediction on the oil price over time, 
the gold price has a trend to increase in the future five years. Then we predict that the GDP growth rate might increase in the future. As we did a
regression of GDP over oil price we can predict the specific amount of GDP growth rate in the future five years. As we find before, the GDP growth 
rate has negative correlation with protest frequency and positive with CPI, so there might be less protest frequency and higher 
CPI in the future in Libya.

Then, we did two two sample t-test and find out there are significant difference between GDP growth rate in Libya and Zimbabwe, and there is no 
significant difference between GDP growth rate in Egypt and South Africa. This reveal that there might be some economic linke between Lybia and Zimbabwe
, which is worth of further delve. 

In conclusion, we predict that the political enironment in Libya will be more stable but the corruption degree would be more severe. With this conclusion, I
hope we can offer some helpful information for some international organizations and investors.
